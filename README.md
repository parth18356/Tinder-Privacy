# Tinder-Privacy

1. We will be making a code where we can read the text from the screen.
a. If possible we will be able to make segments from which our code can read the PII as there are
specific allotted region in Tinder where name, location and bio is being displayed.
b. If this is not possible, due to any complications.
i. Then we will be scraping the website
ii. Or by manually asking the user to enter the PII which they are able to see.
2. Then that text which is the PII will be saved in a .csv file.
3. Later another code will be reading the .csv file PII elements.
4. Then we will be processing those PII information to make a query for facebook
search.
5. If the profile is matched then we will be showing the 2 best fit profiles
